&lt;p&gt;A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, &quot;to write beside&quot; or &quot;written beside&quot;) is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. Paragraphs on Fireside are indented rather than spaced, as a nod to traditional text block design.&lt;/p&gt;
